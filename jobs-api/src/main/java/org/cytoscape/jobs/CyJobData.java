/**
 * CyJobData presents a general interface to sending data to and receiving
 * data from a job.  The api is meant to be very similar to that of a 
 * {@link Map}, with {@link String} keys and arbirary {@link Object Objects}
 * as values.  Note that no type checking is done -- the values might
 * contain other {@link Map Maps}, {@link List Lists} or a variety of
 * other objects (notably Cytoscape model and view model objects).  The
 * detailed implementation for this object is managed by a {@link CyJobDataService}
 * which should be able to use the information contains within the object to
 * create the appropriate data structure to send to a remote job 
 * ({@see CyJobDataService#getSerializedData(CyJobData)}) and retrieve the
 * information from the remote job ({@see CyJobDataService#unSerialize(Object)}).
