/**
 * A {@link CyJob} represents all of the state information necessary to 
 * marshal and unmarshal data, submit jobs, query job status, and fetch
 * results.  As such it is the main state object for the CyJob mechanism.
 * This is also the object that gets saved and restored from sessions by
 * the {@link CyJobManager}.  Typically, {@link CyJob CyJobs} are implemented
 * by the appropriate {@link CyJobExecutionService}, which may have
 * different state that needs to be stored in the object or serialized/deserialized
 * from sessions.  Typically, once an App has created a {@link CyJob} 
 * (using {@link CyJobExecutionService#getCyJob(String, String)}) it
 * shouldn't require any other references to jobs objects since it should
 * contain all necessary state.
