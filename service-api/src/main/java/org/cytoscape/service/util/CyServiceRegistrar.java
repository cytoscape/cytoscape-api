 * if you need to register services outside of {@code AbstractCyActivator}'s
 * {@code start} method.
 *
 * This class differs in one important way from {@code AbstractCyActivator}.
 * {@code AbstractCyActivator} maintains a list of requested services. When
 * the bundle is stopped, {@code AbstractCyActivator} releases
 * these services. {@code CyServiceRegistrar} also maintains a list
 * of requested services, but this list is separate from {@code AbstractCyActivator}.
 * Services requested through this class must be released using one of
 * the {@code unregisterService} methods when the bundle is stopped.
