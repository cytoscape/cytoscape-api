	 * Note that method annotations require both a getter and a setter method to get and set a 
	 * value. Only the getter method needs to be annotated.  The getter method must take no arguments
	 * and return a value and be named with the prefix "get".  The setter method does not need a 
	 * {@link Tunable} annotation, however the method must take a single argument of the same type as
	 * the getter method, it must return void, it must be named with the prefix "set", and the
	 * rest of the name must match that of the getter method.  See {@link Tunable} for an example.
	 * 
	 * @param getter    A getter method that has been annotated with {@link Tunable}. 
	 * @param setter    A setter method that matches the getter method. 
	 * @param instance  The object on which we want to invoke the <code>getter</code> and <code>setter</code> methods.
	 * @param tunable   The Tunable that contains all the information concerning the user interface from the getter method.
	 * @return T       The newly constructed <code>TunableHandler</code> or null if this factory
	 * can't handle the specified type.
