/**
 * TunableRecorder is a special type of tunable interceptor that 
 * reads the state of the tunables <b>but does not modify the 
 * value of the tunables</b>. There may be many TunableRecorder
 * services registered at once.  TunableRecorders will be
 * called by the {@link TaskManager} <i>after</i> the 
 * {@link TunableMutator} is called, but <i>before</i> the
 * {@link Task} is executed.
 * </br>
 * TunableRecorders are designed to help record the state of
 * Cytoscape for provenance and other tracability purposes.
 * </br>
 * When implementing this interface, it is recommended that you
 * use the {@link AbstractTunableInterceptor} class to do so.
 * @param <T> The generic TunableHandler type of this TunableRecorder.
