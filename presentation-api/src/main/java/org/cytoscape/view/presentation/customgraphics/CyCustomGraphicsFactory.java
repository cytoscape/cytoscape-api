 * the type of the underlying {@link CustomGraphicLayer} not the type
 * of the resulting {@link CyCustomGraphics} object this creates. In general,
 * the pattern is to add to your CyActivator class:
 *
 * <pre>	
  		CyCustomGraphicsFactory myCustomGraphicsFactory = new MyCustomGraphicsFactory();
  		registerService(bundleContext, myCustomGraphicsFactory, CyCustomGraphicsFactory.class, new Properties());
  </pre>
