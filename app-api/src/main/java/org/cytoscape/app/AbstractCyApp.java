/**
 * The primary app interface for Cytoscape that all

 * that use AbstractCySwingApp found in the org.cytoscape.app.swing
 * package.
 * There are limitations on which packages may
 * be included in the app jar based on those already loaded in the classpath.
 * To load alternative versions of the same library used by other apps or
